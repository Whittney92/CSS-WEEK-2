<b></b><h4> Who I am and how I got started into being a fitness coach </h4>
<p class="shadow-text" id="large paragraph">What’s up guys my name is Whittney a.k.a. Coach Whit! I was born and raised in Louisville Kentucky, Go Cardinals! My dog son: Marlo and I moved to Lexington two years ago for a change of scenery. I absolutely love Lexington as well as the business opportunities and friends I have gained along the way. <br><p>I am a full-time Chiropractor Assistant and part-time health/fitness coach. I love helping others achieve a healthier outlook on being healthy and feeling good. I began my health journey at the age of 14 years old when I hit 160lbs! I know what you are thinking… 160lbs is nothing… but it is when you are 5’2. I also grew up in a family with health issues like obesity, high blood pressure and cancer. I hated the way I felt and looked so I decided to do something about it… I began teaching myself the importance of eating right and working out, next thing you know I lost 30lbs and never looked back. </p><br><p>I began receiving health questions from others and helping others with achieving a broader outlook on being healthy, feeling amazing and accomplishing personal fitness goals while doing so. At age 22 I decided to take online nutrition classes to earn my certification in Specialized Nutrition. Shortly after I decided to study to become a Personal Trainer. Since then, at age 30, I’ve had many titles as a cycling coach, group trainer and nutrition coach.</p><br><p>I love to lead my training with a wellness approach. Looking good is great but what is it if you truly don’t feel good within? I teach all my clients the importance of mental health… if you don’t have a positive outlook on things then your health journey will be a hard road. It’s important to have patience with self and enjoy the journey.</p><br><p>Love your body at every stage!</p>


<p>Below I've provided a macronutrients chart to give a break down of the percentage of each macro I would consume.You can add this into <i><b>My Fitness Pal</i></b></p>
<table>
   
<tr> <!--Created a table to show the reader the percentage of each food group I began consuming, this way the reader can visually see than just assuming the amount of food i eat. This also provide the reader with a slight "freebie" by adding this info into the calorie caculator.-->
